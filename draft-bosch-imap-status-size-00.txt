    Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - STATUS=SIZE Extension
                    draft-bosch-imap-status-size-00

Abstract

   This document adds a new capability called "STATUS=SIZE" to the
   Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).  It defines a new data item
   called "SIZE" for the STATUS command.  This allows retrieving the
   total storage size of a mailbox with a single STATUS command.
   Without the "STATUS=SIZE" capability, it is necessary to retrieve and
   sum the sizes of all individual messages in that mailbox.  When the
   "LIST-STATUS" IMAP capability is also available, the storage sizes of
   many mailboxes can be queried at once using just one LIST command.
   This capability is particularly useful for IMAP clients that do not
   cache the state of the message store.

Internet-Draft        IMAP - STATUS=SIZE Extension            April 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document extends Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
   [IMAP4rev1] with a new capability called "STATUS=SIZE".  To determine
   the total storage size of a mailbox, an IMAP client currently needs
   to retrieve all message sizes individually using the FETCH command
   with the RFC822.SIZE data item.  The "STATUS=SIZE" capability
   provides a more efficient means to achieve this.  It extends the
   STATUS command with a new "SIZE" data item, which indicates the total
   size of all messages in the target mailbox.  This way, this
   information can be queried with just one STATUS command.  When the
   "LIST-STATUS" IMAP capability [LIST-STATUS] is also available, the
   SIZE data item can be queried for many mailboxes at once using just
   one LIST command.

   This capability is particularly useful for IMAP clients that do not
   cache the state of the message store, such as most webmail clients.
   Without the "STATUS=SIZE" capability, such clients need to fetch all
   message sizes from the server when the size of a mailbox needs to be
   determined, for example when the user requests detailed quota usage
   information.  The "QUOTA" capability [QUOTA] is no help in that
   scenario, since the provided QUOTAROOT command can only yield the
   "STORAGE" resource usage of a whole quota root, but not for a single
   mailbox within that root.  The "MESSAGE" resource usage for a mailbox
   can already be queried with the existing "MESSAGES" data item of the
   STATUS command.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].


3.  STATUS Command and Response Extensions

   This extension defines one new status data item for the STATUS
   command and response:

   SIZE
      The total size of the mailbox in octets.  This MUST be equal to
      the sum of the [RFC5322] size of all messages in the mailbox.

   Example:

Internet-Draft        IMAP - STATUS=SIZE Extension            April 2015


   C: A01 STATUS frop (MESSAGES SIZE UIDNEXT)
   S: * STATUS frop (MESSAGES 30 SIZE 44421 UIDNEXT 242344)
   S: A01 OK STATUS completed

   When the LIST-STATUS IMAP capability [LIST-STATUS] is also available,
   the STATUS command can be combined with the LIST command to further
   improve efficiency.  This way, the sizes of many mailboxes can be
   queried with just one LIST command.

   Example:

   C: A02 LIST "" % RETURN (STATUS (MESSAGES SIZE))
   S: * LIST () "."  "INBOX"
   S: * STATUS "INBOX" (MESSAGES 17 SIZE 16234)
   S: * LIST () "." "frop"
   S: * STATUS "frop" (MESSAGES 30 SIZE 44421)
   S: A02 OK List completed.


4.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification augments the grammar specified in
   [IMAP4rev1].  It uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation
   as specified in [ABNF].  Elements not defined here are taken from
   [IMAP4rev1].

   status-att /= "SIZE"


5.  Security Considerations

   There are no known additional security issues with this extension
   beyond those described in the base protocol described in [IMAP4rev1].


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add "STATUS=SIZE" to the "IMAP Capabilities"
   registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap-capabilities>.
