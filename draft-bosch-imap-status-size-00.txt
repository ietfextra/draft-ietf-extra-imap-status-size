Internet-Draft        IMAP - STATUS=SIZE Extension            March 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document extends Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
   [IMAP4rev1] with a new capability called "STATUS=SIZE".  Currently,
   an IMAP client needs to retrieve all message sizes individually using
   the FETCH command with the RFC822.SIZE data item to determine the
   total size of a mailbox.  The "STATUS=SIZE" capability provides a
   more efficient means to achieve this.  It extends the STATUS command
   with a new SIZE data item, which indicates the total size of all
   messages in the target mailbox.  This way, this information can be
   queried with just one STATUS command.  When the LIST-STATUS IMAP
   capability [LIST-STATUS] is also available, the SIZE data item can be
   queried for many mailboxes at once using just one LIST command.

   [FIXME: some application examples]


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].


3.  STATUS Command and Response Extensions

   This extension defines one new status data item for the STATUS
   command and response:

   SIZE
      The total size of the mailbox in octets.  This MUST be equal to
      the sum of the [RFC5322] size of all messages in the mailbox.

   Example:

   C: A01 STATUS frop (MESSAGES SIZE UIDNEXT)
   S: * STATUS frop (MESSAGES 30 SIZE 44421 UIDNEXT 242344)
   S: A01 OK STATUS completed

   When the LIST-STATUS IMAP capability [LIST-STATUS] is also available,
   the STATUS command can be combined with the LIST command to further
   improve efficiency.  This way, the sizes of many mailboxes can be
   queried with just one LIST command.

   Example:

Internet-Draft        IMAP - STATUS=SIZE Extension            March 2015


   C: A02 LIST "" % RETURN (STATUS (MESSAGES SIZE))
   S: * LIST () "."  "INBOX"
   S: * STATUS "INBOX" (MESSAGES 17 SIZE 16234)
   S: * LIST () "." "frop"
   S: * STATUS "frop" (MESSAGES 30 SIZE 44421)
   S: A02 OK List completed.


4.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification augments the grammar specified in
   [IMAP4rev1].  It uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation
   as specified in [ABNF].  Elements not defined here are taken from
   [IMAP4rev1].

   status-att /= "SIZE"


5.  Security Considerations

   There are no known additional security issues with this extension
   beyond those described in the base protocol described in [IMAP4rev1].


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add "STATUS=SIZE" to the "IMAP Capabilities"
   registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap-capabilities>.
